PREFACE.

 

THIS volume consists of an accurate transcript of
the original private Account Book of Robert J3enett,
Bursar of the Priory of Durham for the period of four
years, from Whitsuntide 1530, to Whitsuntide 1534.
One gathering of paper in the first year, consisting
apparently of about twenty leaveS, is unfortunately want-
ing. ΤΙιθ book is of a small quarto size, in a wrapper
of parchment without bo'ards, and is preserved in the
office of the auditor of the Bishop of Durham.’¹¹‘

Other books of the same character, more or less per-
fect, are in the custody of the Dean and Chapter of
Durham3 but, as they contain more of receipt than
expenditure, each book being preceded by a rental,
which is the same in every year, and few of them enter-

ing into much detail with respect to purchases or pay-

* In the book is a loose ·letter-back‚ containing references to some of
its contente, in the handwritingw of the person to whom it is addressed,—
‘⁴ To his woorthy freinde Μ’ John Richardson, at his house in Durham‚
these dd.” Now, as John Richardson held an office in the Exchequer‚
under the Bishop of Durham, in the earlier part of the seventeenth cen-

tury, it is probable tha? the book has been preserved in its present place
of custody at least since his period.
