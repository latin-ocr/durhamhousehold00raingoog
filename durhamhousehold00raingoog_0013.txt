⁴*deposited in the treasury or muniment room of the
convent. The Bursar’s Books here printed contain the
most minute details of Itis own proceedings as Bursar
during their respective years, ⁴and their substance was
duly transferred to his great annual account roll—but
their substance only. In the roll he contents himself
with stating in general terms his expenditure under its
respective heads3 but here in his book we have daily
’ memoranda under every department within his care,
with the most minute specification of names and priceS,
together with numerous other entries to aid his me-

to much voluntary and valuable information of this
nature, the fly-leaves at the beginning and end of
each year abound with the most curious entries, which
the Bursar intended for no eye save his own3 but these
entries do not constitute the chief value of his book. ,

whole consumption in short of the great monastery of
,Durham for four yearS, most minutely detailed. Men
and their wageS‚ prices and quantities, necessarias and
luxurieS‚ are all set forth to the inquisitive 'reader by a
