Wommn, 24, 191, 297. The peyment
here 11111119 is stated in the Book for
1507, to be for wodhire, the word
being written et baffi, in 1509 vode-

all probably denoting the hire or ont-
rent of the wood. In 11119 our Book the
word is never written at length, and in
1538 and 1539 it iz eelled wodyeron,
